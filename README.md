# LinkShortener seems like a simple tool, but it is a service that can have a dramatic impact on your marketing efforts.

Link shorteners work by transforming any long URL into a shorter, more readable link. When a user clicks the shortened version, they’re automatically forwarded to the destination URL.

Think of a short URL as a more descriptive and memorable nickname for your long webpage address. You can, for example, use a short URL like bit.ly/CelebrateBitly so people will have a good idea about where your link will lead before they click it.

If you’re contributing content to the online world, you need a URL shortener.

Make your URLs stand out with our easy to use free link shortener above.
